Title: Effect of high school satisfaction on studying and working decisions
Abstract:  High school is the place in which a society forges its future, by teaching to the youth skills useful in several environments. In this paper, we analyze the effect of being satisfied with high school on the choice of university and work after graduation. After controlling for the possibility of endogeneity, the study reveals that being satisfied with  high school increases significantly the probability of enrolling in the university and lowers the probability of going to work right after high school graduation. Finally, the paper concludes looking for and assessing possible heterogeneity between different groups of students.
