Title: 
Effect of high school satisfaction on studying and working decisions.

Abstract:  
High school is the place in which a society forges its future, by teaching to the youth skills useful in several environments. In this paper, we analyze the effect of being satisfied with high school on the choice of going to university, or starting to work. This choices are not mutually exclusive since a student could also both work and study or neither work nor study. Controlling for endogeneity, the study reveals that being satisfied with high school increases significantly the probability of enrolling in the university and lowers the probability of going to work right after high school graduation. Finally, the paper concludes looking for and assessing possible heterogeneity between different groups of students.
